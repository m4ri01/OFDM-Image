# OFDM-Framework-LabVIEW
This is an OFDM framework based on LabVIEW and USRP. This framework contains a complete physical layer structure refferred to 802.11a package.<br />  
It includes common OFDM modulation and demodulation, ferquency offset estimation and correction via WLAN STF, LTF and SIG. And supports binary convolution channel coding and high order symbol mapping.<br />  
Gnerally, it is already a complete framework. Although it may have some bugs, but it is tough enough to be a good template. And I will keep updating utill June, 2017<br />  
You can visit my website to ask for help and I will share experience about build this framework and other notations.<br />
